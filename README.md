# Final project: Global Macroeconomic Outlook
## Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp

**Research question:** Are we about to enter the next big world economical crisis?

**Goals:** Compare current trends in world economic indicators to the trends in previous crisis periods to assess whether the world is about to enter or perhaps already in the next global recession. Predict next year's (2023) indicators.

**Main indicator of recession:** real per capita global GDP

**Further important indicators of economical activity:** Inflation, unemployment, government debt, house prices, current account balance, government expenditure, industrial production, trade, capital flows, business confidence

## Scope of the project

Macroeconomic indicators from 1961-2021 are used to predict the expected indicators for 2022 and 2023 using time series analysis as well as conventional regression models.

The predictions are then fed into a neural neural network with the aim of labeling the predicted years as recession, recovery or expansion years.
